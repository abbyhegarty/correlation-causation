  <h1> What is correlation used for? </h1>
 <p> 
Correlation is a type of association between quantative varibales used to show the strength of a relationship between two variables. The relationship, as Cairo emphasizes thoughout the chapter, is a linear one.

  <h1>What is the difference between correlation and causation?</h1>
 <p>
  Although correlation does not always entail causation, a strong correlation can be a good indicator that there is causation. Just because there is a correlation between two variables, the correlation didn't necessarily occur as a result of a relationship between the two variables. For there to be causation, there must be a relationship between the two variables where the response of one variable is due to the other variable. A way to confidently determine if there is causation is to run randomized controlled experiments.

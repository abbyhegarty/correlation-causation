  <h1> What is correlation used for? </h1>
 <p> 
Correlation is a type of association between quantative varibales used to show the strength of a relationship between two variables. The relationship, as Cairo emphasizes thoughout the chapter, is a linear one. 
</p>
  
  <h1>What is the difference between correlation and causation?</h1>
 <p>
  Although correlation does not always entail causation, a strong correlation can be a good indicator that there is causation. Just because there is a correlation between two variables, the correlation didn't necessarily occur as a result of a relationship between the two variables. For there to be causation, there must be a relationship between the two variables where the response of one variable is due to the other variable. A way to confidently determine if there is causation is to run randomized controlled experiments.       
    </p>
  
  <h1>Compare and contrast 3 different ways to visually show relationships.</h1>
<ol>
  <li> Locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS): 
    <p>
      Rather than just a regular scatter plot or even bar graph, the curve can better help visualize where the data points are most dense. Additionally, the individual points can be color-coded to avoid having to draw multiple curves on one graph.
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li>Scatter Plot Matrix
    <p>
      Scatter plot matrices are excellent at helping to compare multiple variables at once in one single plot. Visually, they can be hard to understand but color can again be used as an indicator to simplify the data like in the LOWESS.
